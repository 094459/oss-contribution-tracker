# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), as much as
a website reasonably can. Backwards incompatible changes (requiring a major version bump) will be
described here, and may involve database changes, significant workflow changes, or changes that
require manual edits to pluggable interfaces.

## Unreleased

### Improvements to strategic projects

## 1.2.1
## Changed
- Fixed CVE issues

## 1.2.0
## Added
- Added support for strategic projects to function on an organization level. Now you can add an entire org to your strategic project instead of only individual projects making it easier for you to track your users contributions!
- To enable support you need to run the below against your DB to add a new column

>  ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN project_is_org BOOLEAN;
>
>  UPDATE projects SET project_is_org = false;
>
>  ALTER TABLE projects ALTER COLUMN project_is_org SET NOT NULL;

## Changed
- Added radio button when adding/editing projects to support the above new feature.
- Fixed data bug when editing a project.
- updated package.json to new version.

## 1.1.1
## Changed
- Split a couple of functions where I was being more fancy than I needed to so I could conform to new typescript rules.
## Added
- Strategic projects and groups will now display a edit button for users that are part of the admin posix/ldap group. This button is a direct link to editing the project or group on the admin page to allow for quicker updates.
## Security
- Upgraded webpack-dev-server due to CVE on the 3.1.10 version.

## 1.1.0

### Changed
- Added config for the browser (browser/config.js) to control the simpleContributions workflow.
- strategicLogger.ts can stampede the GitHub API and throw abuse errors so I added a sleep function (random sleep between 3 and 12 seconds) to stutter the requests.
- Dates are actually displayed when editing a contribution
- Fixed bug with webpack creating bundles under the wrong name.

### Added
- This CHANGELOG.md! Unless requested I am not going to backfill the changelog.
- Simple contribution process. This adds a new way to submit contributions that allows for automatic approval based on type and size of contribution. These are setup through the config.contributions.autoApprove object which allows you to specify the allowed length of the change as well as differing types.
  - This includes additional default values that need to be filled out by the user.
- Adjusted the software to fail on launch if the config is not properly filled out.
- Strategic project users now has a column that will open the users GitHub page.

### Security
- Updated multiple dependencies to newer and secure versions.
- Removed flatmap since it is now crypto malware.
